    "\n",
    "With the exception of dynamics (dynamical RVs and orbits), PHOEBE computations scale with the number of data points (roughly linearly after some up-front costs).  As discussed in previous tutorials (see [Tutorial: Datasets](./Tutorial_03_datasets.ipynb) and [Tutorial: Time and Phase](./Tutorial_04b_time_and_phase.ipynb)), the model can be computed at different times than the input observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For systems without time-dependence (no apsidal motion, etc), it can therefore be quite advantageous to compute the forward model sampled in phase-space and interpolate when comparing to the observations (PHOEBE will handle this interpolation for you).  Just check to make sure that you sample sufficiently in phase that the linear interpolation won't introduce artifacts."

    "\n",
    "By default, at each time point, PHOEBE will check to see if the maximum radius of all meshes would overlap at all on the sky-projection.  If so, the complete eclipse algorithm is called to determine the visibility of each triangle, and if not, triangles are only checked to determine if facing towards or away from the observer (horizon detection).  In cases where you _know_ eclipses will never occur (ellipsoidal variables, for example), this can be optimized slightly by telling PHOEBE to skip this check and only use horizon detection. "
