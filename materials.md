# Installing & Setup

### Jupyter Notebooks

The tutorials at the workshop will make heavy use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install).  If you'd prefer, you can copy and paste from the files into an interactive Python or IPython session, but if you'd like to follow along directly in Jupyter, please make sure that you have Jupyter up and running and can import PHOEBE (more on that next).

The Jupyter notebooks (and talks) will all be linked below so that you can pull them up to view in the browser, or download and run locally on your own machine as we go through them. Please note, these will not be avilable until we solidify the program.

### Installing PHOEBE

During the workshop, we will be using the recently-released 2.4 version of PHOEBE.  We'll also be using `emcee` for the second on-line component of the workshop (feel free to remove emcee below if you're only attending the first week).  The easiest way to install it is via pip (you're welcome to install within a virtual or conda environment if you'd like, just make sure you know how to activate that environment from within Jupyter):

```
pip install numpy
pip install phoebe
pip install emcee
```

Note that PHOEBE only supports Python 3.6+, so you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3` or even `python3 -m pip` depending on your system.

If you're on a newer mac system and PHOEBE fails to build, you may need to first install a supported compiler.  The easiest way to do this is to install PHOEBE within a conda environment where you first install a compiler (`conda install clangxx_osx-64`).  See the [mac install instructions](http://phoebe-project.org/install/latest/mac/auto) for more details (and just swap out the `pip install phoebe` with the line above to install the workshop version).

Similarly, if you are on a Linux system without `g++` or `python3-dev` installed by default, you may need to manually install a few dependencies.  See the [Linux install instructions for 2.3](http://phoebe-project.org/install/latest/linux/auto) and swap out the `pip install phoebe` with the line above to install the workshop version.

You can check to make sure the correct version is installed in a Python console (or Jupyter if you plan to use that at the workshop):

* `import phoebe`
* `print(phoebe.__version__)`

If you have any troubles before the meeting, please reach out to us for assistance.


### Testing Your Installation

**[TEST SCRIPT NEEDS UPDATING]**

Please test your installation well in advance of the workshop by running the [test script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-workshop/2022june/test_install.py) (should take 10-60 seconds to run) and make sure it completes without any errors (warning messages are not a cause for concern).  If the script does not run successfully, please reach out to us so we can debug any installation issues in advance.
