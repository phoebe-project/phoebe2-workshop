# Meeting Location

The 2021 meeting will be virtual due to COVID-19 and will make use of Zoom and Slack (you should have received an invitation link to Slack once confirming your participation - all further communication will go through the Slack workspace).  Video links will be posted both on Slack and on the [materials page](./materials.md) as soon as possible.
