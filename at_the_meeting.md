# Meeting Location

The 2022 meeting will consist of two components, an in-person, introductory component and an advanced, virtual component that will focus on fitting. 

The in-person component will take place at Villanova University, Villanova, PA 19085, USA.

The virtual component will make use of Zoom and Slack and will take place every Tuesday for 5 weeks.  For this component, we selected an on-line format so that the participants have time to apply the newly learned tools and stratergies to their own data.
