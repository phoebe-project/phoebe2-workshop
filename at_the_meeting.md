# Meeting Location

The 2022 meeting will consist of two components, an in-person, introductory component and an advanced, virtual component that will focus on fitting. 

The in-person component of the Workshop will be held in Bartley 2044 at Villanova University, Villanova, PA 19085.

The virtual component will make use of Zoom and SLACK and will take place every Tuesday for 5 weeks.  For this component, we selected an on-line format so that the participants have time to apply their newly learned tools and stratergies to their own data. 

# Food Options and Local Map

Breakfast and lunch will be provided as a part of the Workshop during the first componet. For dinners and weekend meals, please take a look at the [on-campus food locations](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/services/dining/hours/summer.html). As the on-campus food options are limited during the summer, alternative options include several restaraunts that are within walking distance of the apartments. Additionally, nearby towns of Wayne and Rosemont which are easily accessible by train (commuter train cost ~$10 round-trip) or Uber/Lyft have many options.
