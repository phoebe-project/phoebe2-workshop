# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Sixth PHOEBE 2 workshop! This year, the workshop will follow a hack-week format (implementing new features in PHOEBE as well as using PHOEBE for real science use-cases) and focus on advanced topics. The workshop will take place at the University of Ljubljana on June 10th - June 14th 2024.

The aim of this workshop is to give participants a chance to collaboratively contribute to PHOEBE as well as to work on their own personal science with PHOEBE.  General knowledge and comfort with PHOEBE is considered a prerequisite - previous workshop attendees are encouraged to attend as are new participants who commit to running through the online tutorials and/or recordings from last year's workshop in advance. 

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016, Horvat et al. 2018, Jones et al. 2020, Conroy et al. 2020) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many updated features.  The model includes new advanced fitting, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features.  In addition to this vast array of new features, the frontend has also been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

# Main Objectives
The workshop will take place over five days and follow a loosely-scheduled hack-week format.  The majority of the time will be dedicated to working on individual or small-group hacks - using PHOEBE to fit real data, creating new example notebooks that illustrate advanced workflows, fixing bugs, implementing features, etc.  We will work to create a collaborative and open environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their progress and challenges as well as asking and answering questions.  By the end of the workshop, participants can expect to have made progress on their own science using PHOEBE and/or feel more confident modifying and contributing to the source code.
