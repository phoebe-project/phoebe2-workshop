# Announcement  
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Seventh PHOEBE Workshop, which will be held in Yunnan, China!

This in-person workshop offers an introduction to PHOEBE and will take place at the Yunnan University Astronomical Observatory in Kunming, China, from 4th to 15th August 2025. The two-week workshop is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive introduction to PHOEBE 2, offering hands-on experience in creating and fitting binary star models. 

# Scientific Rationale  
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016, Horvat et al. 2018, Jones et al. 2020, Conroy et al. 2020) is a highly versatile binary star modeling code, renowned for its advanced features. The code includes an extensive fitting suite, support for extinction, spin-orbit misalignment, and many additional capabilities. Furthermore, the interface has been completely updated and is now built on the Python programming language.

# Main Objectives  
The workshop spans two intensive four-day weeks, with each day featuring lectures and tutorials accompanied by targeted assignments to ensure participants become well-versed in PHOEBE 2. During the first week, attendees will participate in introductory tutorials and gain practical experience in creating binary star models. The second week will explore solving the inverse problem using PHOEBE, with a focus on heuristics and probabilistic inference. By the conclusion of the workshop, participants will be equipped to independently use PHOEBE 2 to develop forward models of binary systems and to apply its fundamental fitting functionalities to match models to observational data.
