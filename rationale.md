# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Third PHOEBE 2 Workshop that will take place (virtually) on June 22nd - July 1st 2021.

The aim of this two week-long workshop is to give participants a thorough introduction to modeling binary systems using PHOEBE 2, as well as providing a closer look at some of the advanced features.

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many updated features.  The model includes new advanced fitting, a new graphical user interface, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features.  In addition to this vast array of new features, the frontend has also been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

# Main Objectives
The workshop will be divided into two four-day weeks where each day will contain half a day of talks/tutorial (late morning/afternoon east-cost time) and half a day of self-study with targeted assignments.  The first four days will be directed towards introducing PHOEBE, where participants will take part in introductory walk-through tutorials to PHOEBE 2 and will acquire hands-on experience with creating binary star models.  By the end of the first week, participants should be able to independently use PHOEBE 2 to create a forward model of a basic binary system.

The second week will be dedicated to generating a more sophisticated PHOEBE model and will concentrate on advanced fitting methods and advanced features.  By the end of the second week, participants should be able to model binary systems using advanced features.
