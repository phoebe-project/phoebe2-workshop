# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Fourth PHOEBE 2 Workshop! There will be two components to the up-coming workshop - an introductory component that will take place at Villanova University  that will take place (virtually) on June 20th - June 24th 2022 and an advance-fitting on-line component that will take place every Tuesday from June 28th - July 26th 2022.

The aim of the in-person componet is to give participants a thorough introduction to modeling binary systems using PHOEBE 2. The aim of the second on-line component is to work through some of the advanced features whilst giving participants time to apply their new tools and knowledge to their own data with the aim of producing publishable results. 

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many updated features.  The model includes new advanced fitting, a new graphical user interface, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features.  In addition to this vast array of new features, the frontend has also been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

# Main Objectives
The first component of the workshop will take place over five days where each day will contain talks and tutorials with targeted assignments so that the participants become familiar with the workings of PHOEBE 2. During this week, participants will take part in introductory walk-through tutorials to PHOEBE 2 and will acquire hands-on experience with creating binary star models.  By the end of the first week, participants should be able to independently use PHOEBE 2 to create a forward model of a basic binary system and will have knowledge of some of the basic fitting functionality.

The second component will be dedicated to generating a more sophisticated PHOEBE model and will concentrate on advanced fitting methods and advanced features.  By the end of the second, on-line component, participants should have or be working towards a binary model of their own data that is of publishable quality.
