# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Seventh PHOEBE Workshop taking place in Yunnan, China!  

The in-person Workshop will provide participants with an introduction to PHOEBE. The Workshop will take place at XXX on XXXX.

The aim of the Workshop is to give participants a thorough introduction to modeling binary systems using PHOEBE 2, including a day that is dedicated to fitting with estimators, optimizers and samplers.

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016, Horvat et al. 2018, Jones et al. 2020, Conroy et al. 2020) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many advanced features.  The model includes an extensive fitting suite, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features. Additionally, the interface has been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

# Main Objectives
The Workshop will take place over two four day weeks where each day will contain talks and tutorials with targeted assignments so that the participants become familiar with the workings of PHOEBE 2. During the first week, participants will take part in introductory walk-through tutorials to PHOEBE 2 and will acquire hands-on experience with creating binary star models. The second week will be dedicated to the inverse problem and fitting methods.  By the end of the Workshop, participants should be able to independently use PHOEBE 2 to create a forward model of a binary system and will be able to apply PHOEBE's basic fitting functionality to fit a model to data.
