# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Sixth PHOEBE Workshop! The aim of the workshop is to give participants a chance to work on their own personal science with PHOEBE as well as the option to collaboratively contribute to PHOEBE. This year, the workshop will focus on advanced topics and follow a hack-week format (using PHOEBE for real science use-cases alongside implementing new features in PHOEBE). 

General knowledge and comfort with PHOEBE is considered a prerequisite - previous workshop participants are encouraged to attend as are new participants who commit to completing the online tutorials (and/or recordings) from last year's workshop prior to attendance. The workshop will take place at the University of Ljubljana on June 10th - June 14th, 2024.

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016, Horvat et al. 2018, Jones et al. 2020, Conroy et al. 2020) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many advanced features.  The model includes an extensive fitting suite, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features. Additionally, the interface has been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

Following five successful PHOEBE Workshops focused on introducing PHOEBE, we have decided that the sixth workshop will be an advanced workshop to support current PHOEBE users in their quest for binary star models worthy of publication. 

# Main Objectives
The workshop will take place over five days and follow a loosely scheduled hack-week format.  The majority of the time will be dedicated to working on individual or small-group hacks. During this time, participants will: use PHOEBE to fit real data, create new example notebooks that illustrate advanced workflows, learn how to fix bugs, and implement features, etc.  We will work to create a collaborative and open environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their progress and challenges as well as asking and answering questions.  By the end of the workshop, participants can expect to have made progress on their own science using PHOEBE and/or feel more confident modifying and contributing to the source code.
