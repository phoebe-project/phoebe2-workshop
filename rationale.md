# Announcement
The PHOEBE team is excited to announce the Fifth PHOEBE 2 Workshop! The in-person Workshop will provide participants with an introduction to PHOEBE, including a day dedicated to fitting. The Workshop will take place at the University of Ljubljana on June 19th - June 23rd 2023.

The aim of the Workshop is to give participants a thorough introduction to modeling binary systems using PHOEBE 2, including a day that is dedicated to fitting with estimators, optimizers and samplers. 

# Scientific Rationale
PHOEBE 2 (Pr≈°a et al. 2016) is a highly flexible binary star modeling code with many updated features.  The model includes new advanced fitting, a new graphical user interface, support for extinction, support for spin-orbit misalignment, and many more features.  In addition to this vast array of new features, the frontend has also been updated and is now based on the python programming language.

# Main Objectives
The Workshop will take place over five days where each day will contain talks and tutorials with targeted assignments so that the participants become familiar with the workings of PHOEBE 2. During this week, participants will take part in introductory walk-through tutorials to PHOEBE 2 and will acquire hands-on experience with creating binary star models. By the end of the Workshop, participants should be able to independently use PHOEBE 2 to create a forward model of a binary system and will be able to apply PHOEBE's basic fitting functionality to fit a model to their data.
