# # Exercises #2: Creating Forward Models
# 
# These exercises are designed to be done anytime after Tutorial #5 (plotting)

# # \#1: System from Exercises #1
# 
# Pick up where you left off from the [previous exercises](Exercises_01_building_systems.ipynb) and take the systems you created and build and plot forward models.
# 
# Note that PHOEBE isn't well-suited for modeling transiting systems (with planets)... so although you will be able to build forward models for the Sun-Earth and Sun-Jupiter systems, you will need to do so with a large number of triangles and will still be left with significant noise.

# # \#2: Recreate a System from the Literature
# 
# Find a solved EB in the literature and attempt to re-create the model in the paper.  Bonus points if you can find one with published data or a synthetic model to compare directly.
