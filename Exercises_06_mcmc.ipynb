    "# Exercises #6: MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises are designed to be done anytime after Tutorial #11 (MCMC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with your [solution from estimators and optimizers](./Exercises_05_estimators_optimizers.ipynb), setup and submit an MCMC job to sample the local parameter space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will very likely need to run these jobs remotely, so make sure to set `progress_every_niters` so that you can monitor the results and kill/restart the job if necessary.  If you haven't done so already, make sure to determine if any of the expensive effects can safely be disabled (see [optimizing computations](./Tutorial_optimizing_computations.ipynb) from the first week) first so that you can get a reasonable number of iterations."
