For other quantities (orbital/rotation periods, sma, etc), you may need to lookup the values since they do not have units/constants available."

For detached systems, you can use any reported point radii (polar, equatorial, back/front) as approximations for the equivalent radius. If the solution is reported in equipotentials, you can convert them to radii using [phoebe.distortions.roche.pot_to_requiv](http://phoebe-project.org/docs/latest/api/phoebe.distortions.roche.pot_to_requiv) with `d=1-e` (as potentials are defined at periastron) along with an estimate of the semi-major axis from the RV semi-amplitudes, inclination, and eccentricity.
