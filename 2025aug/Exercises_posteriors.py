# # Exercises: Getting Posteriors
# 
# Using the results from your [MCMC run](./Exercises_08_mcmc.ipynb), process the results from MCMC into posteriors and parameter uncertainties.
# 
# Make sure to check for convergence, set `burnin` and `thin` appropriately, and try propagating to parameters not included in sampling (i.e. masses).
