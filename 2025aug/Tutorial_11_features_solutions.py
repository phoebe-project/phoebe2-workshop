import phoebe

# **Plot a light curve with and without a spot.**
# 
# See [this example script](http://phoebe-project.org/docs/latest/examples/binary_spots)

# **Make a mesh plot that shows the presence of a spot and get comfortable with how the coordinate system is defined.  Try for both binary systems and single stars.**

# See [this example script](http://phoebe-project.org/docs/2.4/examples/single_spots)

# **Try creating a synthetic light curve set as in the [Gaussian Process example online](http://phoebe-project.org/docs/2.4/examples/minimal_GPs) and play with different kernel and plotting options.**
